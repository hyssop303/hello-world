Hello World,

Happy Halloween! I enjoy identifying perennial edible and medicinal plants on hikes in Colorado, and native effective plants around the world. 
A useful plant database would be helpful.
I also like growing hyssop in my garden and making tea from it.
Let's teach a robot to weed it and harvest it; as a systems engineer I would love to work on that project.

A while ago as a visual data analysis software sales engineer, I wrote wrappers connecting PV-WAVE with java, c, c++, matlab, fortran, unix.
Wow github dev environment is elegant, thanks for the tutorial. A friend mentioned gtest.h, let's see what it takes to advance to that.

Cheers, Arlene
